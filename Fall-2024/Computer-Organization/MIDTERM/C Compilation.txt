1. Writing the C Source Code (Source File)
The C source code is written in a text editor and saved with a .c extension.
This file is just plain text; the machine cannot directly understand or execute it. It needs to go through multiple stages to become executable.

2. Preprocessing (C Preprocessor)
Command: gcc -E program.c -o program.i (using GCC as the compiler example)
The preprocessor handles preprocessor directives like #include, #define, and conditional compilation (e.g., #ifdef).
#include: Expands header files by replacing the #include <file> line with the actual content of the included file.
#define: Handles macros and replaces them with their defined values.
The output is a .i file (preprocessed source file), which is a C file with all preprocessing directives expanded. This is still in C syntax but without macros or includes.

3. Compilation (Compiler)
Command: gcc -S program.i -o program.s
The compiler takes the preprocessed .i file and translates it into assembly code (a lower-level representation of the program).
Assembly code is specific to the target architecture (e.g., x86, ARM).
The output is a .s file (assembly file).

4. Assembly (Assembler)
Command: gcc -c program.s -o program.o
The assembler converts the assembly code into machine code or object code. This is the binary representation of the program, but it is not yet a complete executable. It consists of a series of instructions specific to the CPU architecture.
The output is an object file with a .o or .obj extension.
The object file contains:
Machine instructions.
Symbol table: holds information about functions and variables (to be resolved during linking).
Unresolved addresses for functions or variables that the program calls but are defined elsewhere.

5. Linking (Linker)
Command: gcc program.o -o program
The linker combines one or more object files and libraries into a final executable.
It resolves symbols (i.e., links function calls to their actual definitions) and binds them to the addresses where the functions and variables will reside in memory.
The linker also includes code from standard libraries (like the C standard library for printf).
If external functions (e.g., printf) are called, the linker includes references to the system’s shared libraries or static libraries.
The result is a complete executable file (on Linux, typically without an extension; on Windows, it would be .exe).

6. Loading and Execution (Loader)
Once the executable file is created, you can run it by calling its name on the command line (e.g., ./program).
The loader, which is part of the operating system, loads the program into memory.
It sets up the runtime environment (stack, heap, data, and code segments).
The program’s execution begins at the entry point (usually main()).
The operating system allocates memory and CPU resources to the program.

7. Summary of Stages
Preprocessing (.i): Handles directives like #include and #define.
Compilation (.s): Converts C code into assembly.
Assembly (.o): Translates assembly into machine code (object file).
Linking (program): Resolves external references and produces the final executable.
Execution: The OS loads and runs the executable in memory.
Additional Considerations
Static Linking vs Dynamic Linking:

Static Linking: All necessary code (including libraries) is included in the final executable. This leads to larger executables but independent of external libraries at runtime.
Dynamic Linking: The executable contains references to shared libraries that are loaded at runtime, reducing file size but requiring that the correct library versions are available on the system.
Optimization:

The compiler can perform optimizations during the compilation phase (e.g., using -O1, -O2, -O3 flags in GCC). These optimizations can improve execution speed, reduce memory usage, or even decrease the executable's size.
Example Commands in GCC Workflow:
Preprocessing: gcc -E hello.c -o hello.i
Compilation: gcc -S hello.i -o hello.s
Assembly: gcc -c hello.s -o hello.o
Linking: gcc hello.o -o hello
Each step in the compilation process brings the C code closer to a binary format that the machine can understand and execute.
